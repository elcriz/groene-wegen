# GroeneWegen
Check and compare environmental specs (emissions, mileage etc.) for vehicles registered in The Netherlands (by their number plate). See https://elcriz.github.io/groene-wegen/.

## A personal side project to learn more about:

- Progressive web app (PWA) development
- React development with function components, rather than classes with lifecycle methods
- React hooks and context
- Async await
- Using RDW OpenData solutions
- etc.

## Roadmap:

- Compare cars by their differences in percentages as an addition to the current side-by-side comparison
- Use locally stored car info when no internet connection (already in use in compare mode)
- Camera capture/photo library import (PRO)
- Automatic number plate recognition functionality (PRO)
